<p>Today we're talking about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Scope</li>
  <li>Hoisting</li>
</ul>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // 1. Create a named function that accepts two parameters:
  //      - a variable that will hold an array
  //      - a variable that will hold a string
  //    Use console.log to print out the length of the array.
  //    Push the string onto the array.
  //    Use console.log to pring out the length of the new array.
  //    Return the new array.

  //    Next, call the function and pass in an empty array and a string.

  // 2. Copy your named function, but now make it an anonymous function
  //    that you assign to a variable.

  // 3. Use console.log() to print out your first (named) function,
  //    and then your second (anonymous) function.

  //    What's the difference between the two?
  //    Let's talk about hoisting.

  // 4. Call your anonymous function and store the results in another variable.

  // 5. Store your anonymous function in another variable name.

  // 6. Write a function that will sort your array based on string length.
  //      (You can use a named function, or store an anonymous function in
  //       a variable.)
  //    Pass this function as a callback to the sort() method and apply it
  //    to one of your spaceship arrays.
  //    Store the result in a NEW variable,
  //    and print both the new and old arrays with console.log().
